Network Traffic Analysis Using Wireshark
Objective

To observe and analyze network traffic in order to understand normal communication patterns and identify suspicious activity.

Tools Used

Wireshark

Windows / Linux environment

Description

Captured and analyzed network packets to study protocols, source/destination addresses, and traffic behavior. The exercise focused on distinguishing normal traffic from potentially anomalous patterns.

Activities Performed

Packet capture on a local interface

Filtering traffic by protocol (HTTP, DNS, TCP)

Reviewing packet headers and payload metadata

Key Learnings

How packet inspection supports threat detection

Importance of baseline traffic knowledge

Practical use of filters to isolate relevant traffic
