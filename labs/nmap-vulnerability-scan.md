Basic Vulnerability Scanning Using Nmap
Objective

To identify open ports and running services on a target system in order to understand potential security exposure.

Tools Used

Nmap

Kali Linux

Description

A basic network scan was performed against a test environment to enumerate open ports and active services. The scan focused on identifying commonly exposed services that may require hardening or further investigation.

Methodology

Identified target IP in a controlled environment

Executed basic Nmap scans (TCP SYN scan)

Reviewed service versions and port states

Findings

Several common service ports were identified as open

Service version information highlighted potential areas for patching

Key Learnings

Importance of regular network scanning

How exposed services increase attack surface

Value of combining scans with patch management and access controls
