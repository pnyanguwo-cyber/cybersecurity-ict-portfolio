## Security Monitoring and Data Visualization Using Splunk

### Tools Used
- Splunk Enterprise
- Splunk Universal Forwarder
- Splunk Processing Language (SPL)

### Objective
To implement centralized log collection, perform security-focused log analysis, and create dashboards and reports for real-time visibility into system and security events.

### Environment
This activity was conducted in a controlled lab and learning environment using test systems and simulated data sources.

### Activities Performed
- Installed and configured Splunk Universal Forwarders on endpoint systems to collect logs.
- Forwarded system, authentication, and application logs to a central Splunk instance.
- Used Splunk Processing Language (SPL) to query and analyze security-related events.
- Developed custom SPL queries to identify patterns such as:
  - Failed and successful authentication attempts
  - Unusual login activity
  - Repeated access attempts and event frequency anomalies
- Created custom dashboards and reports to visualize security events in real time.
- Configured visualizations to support quick interpretation of trends and potential security issues.

### Key Learnings
- Importance of centralized logging for effective security monitoring.
- How SPL enables flexible querying and correlation of security events.
- Value of dashboards and reports in supporting situational awareness and faster incident response.
- How real-time data visualization improves detection and investigation efficiency.

### Security Use Cases Demonstrated
- Authentication monitoring and anomaly detection
- Event trend analysis
- Visibility into endpoint and system activity
- Support for basic incident triage

### Ethical Note
All activities were performed in a lab or learning environment for educational and professional development purposes. No production or client systems were involved.
